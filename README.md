##Installation

There is no installation required for this project.


##Usage

The purpose of this was to demonstrate my understanding of basic javascript alerts and functions, all while making a functioning and responsive website.


##Functionality
This website functions by giving the user prompts and alerts, beginning with asking the user how many characters they would like in their password. If the user enters a number less than 8 or greater than 128, then it will refresh the page and make them enter a number that falls between 8 and 128. Once an acceptable number is entered, the website will ask the user if they want to include any other variables. 

From there, the selected variables will be thrown into an empty container, then pull random characters from that string. Once the user clicks the generate button, the string of random characters will be entered into the text box. The user then has the option to press the "Copy to clipboard" button, then they can paste it wherever they need to.
